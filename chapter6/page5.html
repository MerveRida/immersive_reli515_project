            <p class="verses" id="load"> <sup>3</sup><sup>0</sup> The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him
                all that they had done and taught. <sup>3</sup><sup>1</sup> He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to
                a remote place and rest for a while.” For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have
                time to eat. <sup>3</sup><sup>2</sup> So they went away in the boat by themselves to a remote place,
                <sup>3</sup><sup>3</sup> but many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they ran on foot from all
                the towns and arrived ahead of them. <sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup> When he went ashore, he saw a large crowd
                and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. Then he began to teach them
                many things. <sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> When it grew late, his disciples approached him and said, “This
                place is deserted, and it is already late. <sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> Send them away so that they can go
                into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy themselves something to eat.”
                <sup>3</sup><sup>7</sup> “You give them something to eat,” he responded. They said to him, “Should we go
                and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat? ”
