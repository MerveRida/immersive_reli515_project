            <p class="verses" id="load"> <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> King Herod heard about it, because Jesus’s name had
                become well known. Some said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that’s why miraculous
                powers are at work in him.” <sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> But others said, “He’s Elijah.” Still others said,
                “He’s a prophet, like one of the prophets from long ago.” <sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> When Herod heard of
                it, he said, “John, the one I beheaded, has been raised! ” <sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> For Herod himself
                had given orders to arrest John and to chain him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s
                wife, because he had married her. <sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup> John had been telling Herod, “It is not
                lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” <sup>1</sup><sup>9</sup> So Herodias held a grudge against
                him and wanted to kill him. But she could not, <sup>2</sup><sup>0</sup>because Herod feared John and
                protected him, knowing he was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him he would be very perplexed,

                Herod gave a banquet for his nobles, military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee.
                <sup>2</sup><sup>2</sup> When Herodias’s own daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his
                guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you want, and I’ll give it to you.”
                <sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> He promised her with an oath: “Whatever you ask me I will give you, up to half
                my kingdom.” <sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> She went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for? ”
                “John the Baptist’s head,” she said. <sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup> At once she hurried to the king and said,
                “I want you to give me John the Baptist’s head on a platter immediately.” <sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup>
