Go and see.” When they found out they said, “Five, and two fish.” <sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup> Then he instructed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. <sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup> So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. <sup>4</sup><sup>1</sup> He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves. He kept giving them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. <sup>4</sup><sup>2</sup> Everyone ate and was satisfied. <sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup>They picked up twelve baskets full of pieces of bread and fish. <sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> Now those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.
