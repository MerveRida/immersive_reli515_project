                it, gave it to them, and said, “Take it; this is my body.” <sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> Then he took a cup,
                and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. <sup>2</sup><sup>4</sup> He
                said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. <sup>2</sup><sup>5</sup>
                Truly I tell you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in
                the kingdom of God.” <sup>2</sup><sup>6</sup> After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of
                Olives.
