Remain here and stay awake.” <sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> He went a little farther, fell to the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. <sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> And he said, “Abba, Father! All things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Nevertheless, not what I will, but what you will.”
