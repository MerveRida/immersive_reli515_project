Remain here and stay awake.” <sup>3</sup><sup>5</sup> He went a little farther, fell to the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. <sup>3</sup><sup>6</sup> And he said, “Abba, Father! All things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Nevertheless, not what I will, but what you will.”

                <p class="placetxt">Bethany is recorded in the New Testament as the home of the siblings Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, as well as that of Simon the Leper. Jesus is reported to have lodged there after his entry into Jerusalem, and it could be from Bethany that he parted from his disciples at the Ascension.</p>
