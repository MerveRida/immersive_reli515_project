Follow him. <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Wherever he enters, tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples? ” ’ <sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make the preparations for us there.” <sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> So the disciples went out, entered the city, and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
