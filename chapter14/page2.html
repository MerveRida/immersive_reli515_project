                <p class="verses" id="load"> <sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrifice the Passover lamb, his disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare the Passover so that you may eat it? ” <sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup> So he sent two of his disciples and told them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> Wherever he enters, tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples? ” ’ <sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup> He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make the preparations for us there.” <sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup> So the disciples went out, entered the city, and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.

                <h3>About the Place of the Last Supper</h3>
                <p class="placetxt">Bethany is recorded in the New Testament as the home of the siblings Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, as well as that of Simon the Leper. Jesus is reported to have lodged there after his entry into Jerusalem, and it could be from Bethany that he parted from his disciples at the Ascension.</p>
