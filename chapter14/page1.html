            <h1 class="verses">Mark 14:3-11</h1>
            <p class="verses" id="load"> <sup>3</sup>While he was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as he was
                reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume of pure nard. She
                broke the jar and poured it on his head. <sup>4</sup>But some were expressing indignation to one
                another: “Why has this perfume been wasted? <sup>5</sup> For this perfume might have been sold for more
                than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” And they began to scold her. <sup>6</sup> Jesus
                replied, “Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a noble thing for me. <sup>7</sup>You
                always have the poor with you, and you can do what is good for them whenever you want, but you do not
                always have me. <sup>8</sup> She has done what she could; she has anointed my body in advance for
                burial. <sup>9</sup> Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she
                has done will also be told in memory of her.” <sup>1</sup><sup>0</sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the
                Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>And when they heard
                this, they were glad and promised to give him money. So he started looking for a good opportunity to
                betray him.</p>

            <h3>About Bethany</h3>
            <p class="placetxt">Bethany is recorded in the New Testament as the home of the siblings Mary, Martha, and
                Lazarus, as well as that of Simon the Leper. Jesus is reported to have lodged there after his entry into
                Jerusalem, and it could be from Bethany that he parted from his disciples at the Ascension.</p>
