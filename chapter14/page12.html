            <p class="verses" id="load"> Then he went out to the entryway, and a rooster crowed.
                <sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> When the maidservant saw him again, she began to tell those standing nearby,
                “This man is one of them.” <sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup> But again he denied it. After a little while those
                standing there said to Peter again, “You certainly are one of them, since you’re also a Galilean.”
                <sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup> Then he started to curse and swear, “I don’t know this man you’re talking
                about! ” <sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup> Immediately a rooster crowed a second time, and Peter remembered when
                Jesus had spoken the word to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he
                broke down and wept.

            <h3>About Saint Peter in Gallicantu</h3>
            <p class="placetxt">Bethany is recorded in the New Testament as the home of the siblings Mary, Martha, and
                Lazarus, as well as that of Simon the Leper. Jesus is reported to have lodged there after his entry into
                Jerusalem, and it could be from Bethany that he parted from his disciples at the Ascension.</p>
