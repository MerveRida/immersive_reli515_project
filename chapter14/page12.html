                <sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> When the maidservant saw him again, she began to tell those standing nearby,
                “This man is one of them.” <sup>7</sup><sup>0</sup> But again he denied it. After a little while those
                standing there said to Peter again, “You certainly are one of them, since you’re also a Galilean.”
                <sup>7</sup><sup>1</sup> Then he started to curse and swear, “I don’t know this man you’re talking
                about! ” <sup>7</sup><sup>2</sup> Immediately a rooster crowed a second time, and Peter remembered when
                Jesus had spoken the word to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he
                broke down and wept.

                <h3>About Saint Peter in Gallicantu</h3>
                <p class="placetxt">The church takes its name from the Latin word "Gallicantu", meaning cock's-crow. This is
                    in commemoration of Peter's triple rejection of Jesus "... before the cock crows twice." It is an
                    important destination for pilgrims because this place commemorates:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the appearance of Jesus before the High Priest Caiaphas</li>
                        <li>the death sentence of Jesus imposed by the Sanhedrin</li>
                        <li>the Denial of Peter and his repentance when the rooster crows</li>
                    </ul>
