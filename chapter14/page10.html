He was sitting with the servants, warming himself by the fire. <sup>5</sup><sup>5</sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they could not find any. <sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> For many were giving false testimony against him, and the testimonies did not agree. <sup>5</sup><sup>7</sup> Some stood up and gave false testimony against him, stating, <sup>5</sup><sup>8</sup> “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands, and in three days I will build another not made by hands.’ ” <sup>5</sup><sup>9</sup> Yet their testimony did not agree even on this. <sup>6</sup><sup>0</sup> Then the high priest stood up before them all and questioned Jesus, “Don’t you have an answer to what these men are testifying against you? ” <sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup> But he kept silent and did not answer. Again the high priest questioned him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One? ” <sup>6</sup><sup>2</sup> “I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.” <sup>6</sup><sup>3</sup> Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses? <sup>6</sup><sup>4</sup> You have heard the blasphemy. What is your decision? ” They all condemned him as deserving death. <sup>6</sup><sup>5</sup> Then some began to spit on him, to blindfold him, and to beat him, saying, “Prophesy! ” The temple servants also took him and slapped him.

                <p class="placetxt">Bethany is recorded in the New Testament as the home of the siblings Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, as well as that of Simon the Leper. Jesus is reported to have lodged there after his entry into Jerusalem, and it could be from Bethany that he parted from his disciples at the Ascension.</p>
