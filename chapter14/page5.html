            <h3>About the Mount of Olives</h3>
            <p class="placetxt">The Mount of Olives is frequently mentioned in the New Testament. From it Jesus entered
                Jerusalem at the beginning of the last week of his life (Matthew 21:1; Mark 11:1). Two days before the
                Crucifixion, in his so-called Olivet Discourse, he foretells the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of
                the world (Matthew 24–25; Mark 13; Luke 21).</p>
