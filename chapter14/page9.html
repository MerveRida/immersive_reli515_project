                <p class="verses" id="load"> <sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, suddenly arrived. With him was a mob, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. <sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> His betrayer had given them a signal. “The one I kiss,” he said, “he’s the one; arrest him and take him away under guard.” <sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> So when he came, immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi! ” and kissed him. <sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> They took hold of him and arrested him. <sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> One of those who stood by drew his sword, struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear. <sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> Jesus said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as if I were a criminal, to capture me? <sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> Every day I was among you, teaching in the temple, and you didn’t arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.” <sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> Then they all deserted him and ran away. <sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup> Now a certain young man, wearing nothing but a linen cloth, was following him. They caught hold of him, <sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> but he left the linen cloth behind and ran away naked.

                <p class="placetxt">Bethany is recorded in the New Testament as the home of the siblings Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, as well as that of Simon the Leper. Jesus is reported to have lodged there after his entry into Jerusalem, and it could be from Bethany that he parted from his disciples at the Ascension.</p>
