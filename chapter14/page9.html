            <h1 class="verses">Mark 43-52</h1>
            <p class="verses" id="load"> <sup>4</sup><sup>3</sup> While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve,
                suddenly arrived. With him was a mob, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and
                the elders. <sup>4</sup><sup>4</sup> His betrayer had given them a signal. “The one I kiss,” he said,
                “he’s the one; arrest him and take him away under guard.” <sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> So when he came,
                immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi! ” and kissed him. <sup>4</sup><sup>6</sup> They took
                hold of him and arrested him. <sup>4</sup><sup>7</sup> One of those who stood by drew his sword, struck
                the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear. <sup>4</sup><sup>8</sup> Jesus said to them, “Have you
                come out with swords and clubs, as if I were a criminal, to capture me? <sup>4</sup><sup>9</sup> Every
                day I was among you, teaching in the temple, and you didn’t arrest me. But the Scriptures must be
                fulfilled.” <sup>5</sup><sup>0</sup> Then they all deserted him and ran away. <sup>5</sup><sup>1</sup>
                Now a certain young man, wearing nothing but a linen cloth, was following him. They caught hold of him,
                <sup>5</sup><sup>2</sup> but he left the linen cloth behind and ran away naked.
