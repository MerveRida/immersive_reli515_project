                    <h3>About Saint Peter in Gallicantu</h3>
                    <p class="placetxt">The church takes its name from the Latin word "Gallicantu", meaning cock's-crow. This is
                        in commemoration of Peter's triple rejection of Jesus "... before the cock crows twice." It is an
                        important destination for pilgrims because this place commemorates:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the appearance of Jesus before the High Priest Caiaphas</li>
                            <li>the death sentence of Jesus imposed by the Sanhedrin</li>
                            <li>the Denial of Peter and his repentance when the rooster crows</li>
                        </ul>
