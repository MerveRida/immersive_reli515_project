# immersive_reli515_project

This project is an immesive learning experience for religious studies, created as a final project for RELI 515: Cultural History of New Testament Texts. 
The project brings together immersive elements with Gospel of Mark for the reader to better understand and appreciate the writings in their context, culture, space, and environment.
The code in this github is blended in a Google Earth project to use the 360 photo library and map features of Google.
